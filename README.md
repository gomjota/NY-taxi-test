# NYC Taxi trips analysis

The are two main objectives in this notebook:
- To explore the data offered by NYC about trips taken by NYC taxis 
- To develop a model that can predict the tip amount.

The data used in this notebook have been downloaded from [here](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) using March, June and November. Documentation about this data can be found [here](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf).

The data folder is empty because of the size. If you clone the repository and execute the notebook please make sure to download the data and store it in this folder.
